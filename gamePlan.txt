I am working on unifying things down to one menu for the game.
Also, I am messing with both the server and the client to make things more streamlined.

I am having trouble following / making quick changes as-is

thus, here are my changes as of saturday night:

CLIENT (oneMenuMain.js)
- converted menu items to fight, item, swap, and run.
- converted fight submenu to four buttons with one function with value of move instead of four separate emits
